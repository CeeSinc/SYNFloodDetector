The script has three modes: “Sniffer mode”, “Manual defender mode”, and “Dynamic defender mode”. The first mode acts as a packet sniffer for SYN packets and will calculate and print statistics to a CSV file.

This mode ties in with the Manual defender mode as it allows users to determine appropriate values for the threshold and interval. The final mode, Dynamic defender, calculates a moving average of SYNs per second and compares the current and previous of these averages to determine if there is an attack occurring.
