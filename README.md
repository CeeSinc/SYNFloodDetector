Python script to detect SYN floods, it can connect to a router and enable/disable the TCPintercept command found on Cisco Routers.

The script is designed for Linux operating systems and should be run as root.

The script has three modes: “Sniffer mode”, “Manual defender mode”, and “Dynamic defender mode”. The first mode acts as a packet sniffer for SYN packets and will calculate and print statistics to a CSV file.
This mode ties in with the Manual defender mode as it allows users to determine appropriate values for the threshold and interval. The final mode, Dynamic defender, calculates a moving average of SYNs per second and compares the current and previous of these averages to determine if there is an attack occurring.

TestNormalTraffic.py was used to simulate a normal amount of SYN requests.
